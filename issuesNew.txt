Changes

1) Images are now to be shown in the same width
2) Top border on iPad Mini is too small - see screenshot
3) Move project text slides to the bottom rather than the top
	-> Fixed. 
4) Lose the background on the text slides
	-> Removed background but it looks kinda... empty. 

Bugs

1) Portrait images seem to be positioned oddly on desktop when lightboxed
