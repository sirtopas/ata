- full screen line images look jagged
	- I think the reason for this is the high res of the images. Could add a loader image to lightbox but seems overkill.
- list sort causes layout issues
	- Not worked this out yet. Change the width from 18 -> something like 10 then it goes back to normal...
- arrow overlay
	- Need new arrow image and smoother fadeout?
	- Cropped arrow from Sam's mock. Slightly jagged.
- home screen logo
	- Aligned. Should test on different screen sizes
- change IsUK to Right
	- Done
- text cut off on bottom at Index page
	- Fixed. Check on other screen sizes
	- Fixed on Firefox also.
- Rollovers a bit tempermental when you open the page (sometimes flash the rollover)
	- Fixed: changed the background position to off the screen when not hovered over
