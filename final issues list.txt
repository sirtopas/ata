- full screen line images look jagged
	- I think the reason for this is the high res of the images. Could add a loader image to lightbox but seems overkill.
- list sort causes layout issues
	- Not worked this out yet. Change the width from 18 -> something like 10 then it goes back to normal...
- arrow overlay
	- Need new arrow image and smoother fadeout?
- home screen logo
	- Aligned. Should test on different screen sizes
- change IsUK to Right
- text cut off on bottom at Index page
	- Fixed. Check on other screen sizes
