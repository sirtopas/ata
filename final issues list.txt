- full screen line images look jagged
	- Less noticable with lower quality images
- arrow overlay
	- Still aliasing the .png
- home screen logo
	- Aligned. Should test on different screen sizes
- Project box images are a fixed size. Need to be a percentage, but there's a bug with hovers that is making it problematic to implement.
- Mobile stylesheets
	- Bottom of Index page is cut off on landscape
	- Safari (iPad / iPad Mini at least) is unusable for some reason. Very slow.
	- The media query for iPhone 5 works with portrait but not landscape
